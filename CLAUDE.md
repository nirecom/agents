# Global Claude Code Instructions

## Workflow

Create the following as a TodoWrite checklist and work through each step in order.

1. **Clarify intent** — Run `/clarify-intent`.
   Skip when intent is already clear — `echo "<<WORKFLOW_CLARIFY_INTENT_NOT_NEEDED: <reason>>>"`
   - A `*-intent.md` from a prior session already covers this request
   - The request is self-contained and unambiguous (single-sentence, no design decision needed)
2. **Plan** — Three-stage planning pipeline. Run each stage in order:
   - **2a. Research** — Run `/survey-code` and/or `/deep-research`.
     - `/survey-code`: Skip when the change target is already known (single file/function).
     - `/deep-research`: Skip when no external knowledge is needed.
     - If unnecessary: `echo "<<WORKFLOW_RESEARCH_NOT_NEEDED: <reason>>"`
   - **2b. `/make-outline-plan`** — Propose 2-3 approach options and get user sign-off.
     When `outline-planner` returns `SINGLE_APPROACH_JUSTIFIED`, skips user review and proceeds to 2c.
   - **2c. `/make-detail-plan`** — Produce file-level plan via planner/reviewer loop.
     When single-file AND no design decision needed, skips subagent loop and drafts inline.
   - Skipping Research (2a) does NOT justify skipping the remaining Plan stages.
   - If Plan entirely unnecessary: `echo "<<WORKFLOW_PLAN_NOT_NEEDED: <reason>>"`
   Run `/review-plan-security` when the plan involves secrets, third-party services, or external input.
3. **Branch/Worktree decision** — Consult `rules/branch.md` and `rules/worktree.md`. Decide whether
   to work on main, a feature branch, or a worktree, then record the decision:
   `echo "<<WORKFLOW_BRANCHING_DECIDED: main|branch: <name>|worktree: <path>>"`
4. **Write tests** — **Always write or update tests before modifying source code.** Run `/write-tests`.
   - If unnecessary: `echo "<<WORKFLOW_WRITE_TESTS_NOT_NEEDED: <reason>>"`
5. **Code** — Present a diff in chat before calling Edit. Wait for approval.
6. **Run tests & Security review** — Run all in parallel (single response, multiple tool calls):
   - Bash: run the test suite (PostToolUse hook auto-marks `run_tests` on exit code).
     Manual fallback: `echo "<<WORKFLOW_MARK_STEP_run_tests_complete>>"`
   - Agent: `/review-code-security` as a subagent (conditional: external input / secrets /
     third-party integrations). If unnecessary: `echo "<<WORKFLOW_REVIEW_SECURITY_NOT_NEEDED: <reason>>"`
   - Bash: `review-code-codex --base <merge-base>` for cross-provider adversarial review
     (always parallel, never blocks workflow). Output is shown directly to the user via
     the Bash tool result, so the `## Codex Review: PERFORMED|SKIPPED|FAILED` status line
     is visible without relying on Claude's summary.
7. **Docs** — Run `/update-docs`. Mandatory for every task.
8. **User verification** — Wait for the user to confirm the task is complete.
9. **Commit** — Run `/commit-push`.
10. **Cleanup** — Based on the step 3 decision:
    - **worktree:** Run `/worktree-end` (merge + cleanup). Mandatory; do not skip.
    - **branch:** Confirm PR is created. After the PR is merged (outside this session),
      delete the branch: `git branch -d <name>` then `git push origin --delete <name>`.
    - **main:** Skip.

## Plan Mode Incompatibility

`--permission-mode plan` is incompatible with this workflow — Skill tool invocations
are restricted in that mode. Always use default mode for implementation tasks.

## Docs-only Short-circuit

If every staged file matches the human-facing docs allowlist — any `.md` under `docs/`,
or one of the root-level files `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
`LICENSE.md` — steps 1–6 are auto-bypassed. Only `user_verification` is required before
committing. Root `CLAUDE.md`, `SKILL.md`, and subdirectory `README.md` are behavior/prompt
code and do NOT qualify.

## Workflow State Recovery

The main conversation can reset workflow state only when it has enough holistic context
to judge that a reset is genuinely warranted. Skills and subagents must not reset.
